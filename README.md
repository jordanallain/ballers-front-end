<p>Ballers is an app where you can gather your favorite NBA stars in one place. You
can see their stats and their social media accounts so it is easy to keep up
to date with their antics.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>I wanted to make this app because I don't use social media but a lot of my
favorite NBA stars do. I also wanted to be able to look at one page and see the
stats of all my favorites instead of having to go to each individual team page.</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

- As a user I want to see all my favorite players' stats together.
- As a user I want to be able to browse a list of players to add.
- As a user I want to be able to edit my list of favorite players.
- As an admin I want users to be able to see each others' lists without editing.

<h2>ERD</h2>

<p>I will have a players table with NBA stars in it. There will also be a user table for people that have signed up. Users can browse a list of players to add to their list of favorites. This will create a many to many relationship between users and players through the favorites table.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>The biggest issue I faced coding this app was trying to utilize handlebars in the authentication process. Handlebars did however end up proving to be the most useful tool for displaying the data I wanted delivered back to the user. I am glad I was able to not shun handlebars completely and that I was able to recover from having to restart after a couple days of work. I was not able to get around to styling the app or attempting to include a third party API to attain more data about the players. This is something I look forward to doing in the future.</p>
