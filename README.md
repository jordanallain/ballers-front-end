bALLers

Ballers is an app where you can gather your favorite NBA stars in one place. You
can see their stats and their social media accounts so it is easy to keep up
to date with their antics.

Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible.

Motivation

I wanted to make this app because I don't use social media but a lot of my
favorite NBA stars do. I also wanted to be able to look at one page and see the
stats of all my favorites instead of having to go to each individual team page.
